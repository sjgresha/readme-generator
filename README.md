# README Generator

## Description
This week we were tasked with making a readme file generator using node js. We had to install inquirer and create the js files in order to run and make the readme file in the integrated terminal of VS code. When the program is run the user will be asked questions about the readme file. The corresponding answers will then be taken and used to create the readme file.
